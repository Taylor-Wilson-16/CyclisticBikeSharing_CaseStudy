# Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Certification 

### This project was completed as a part of the Google Data Analytics Certification. 

## Business Task: 
The business goal is to increase the number of annual Cyclistic bike-share memberships, as annual memberships are the most profitable type of participation. In order to do this, discern how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Use this insight to develop recommendations on how to influence casual riders to become annual members. 
## Background Information:
- Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. The company launched in 2016, and has 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations.
- Up until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has been building general awareness and appealing to broad customer segments.
- Casual riders are defined as riders who’ve purchased single-ride or full-day passes. Cyclistic members are riders who’ve purchased an annual membership.
- Cyclistic offers a variety of bike types making their bike-share service more inclusive. 
- Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
